# Svelte Template Parcel

This is a project template for Svelte apps with Parcel.js  

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit alex-parra/svelte-template-parcel svelteParcel
cd svelteParcel
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelteParcel
yarn install
```

...then start the dev server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234).  
You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and the page should reload with your changes.


## Build for Production

Run `yarn build` and then deploy the contents for the `dist` folder
